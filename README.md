## What I Learned
I decided to delve into my creative concepts and experiment with Sass to craft engaging projects. My goal was to maximize the use of CSS alone, which translated into numerous hours meticulously refining details and adjusting properties until achieving the desired outcome. Each step of this journey filled me with a profound sense of joy, appreciation, and further curiosity.
